# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Book review website built as part of CSW50 from EdX.

The website allows user to register and login with userId and Password. Once logged, it is possible to search for books through it's title, author and ISBN number. It is also possible to leave a review and a rating of the book. Lastly, information from Goodreads regarding rating and number of reviews is also given to any specific book.
Moreover, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the websiteâ€™s API.

I tried to give it a nice look, so I downloaded the background pictures from google images and some snippets of HTML/CSS code where inspired by freely available codes in the internet. In these such cases I thus indicated in the code as a comment and copied the webpage.
